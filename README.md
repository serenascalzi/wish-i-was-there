# Wish I Was There Content Strategy

## Mission Statement
For the worldwide traveler or the local resident who is looking to get valuable insiders’ knowledge about destinations across the globe or in their backyard, Wish I Was There connects the user with people who know the area best, based on shared interests and priorities.

## Area Demographics
Las Vegas has a population of 641,708 people and a land area of 135 square miles. There are 4,753 people per square mile and the population’s average age is 38 years old. The majority of the population has a high school degree \(84%\) while the minority has a college degree \(23%\). The population’s median household income is $56,699.

## Competitive Landscape
The top websites used in planning trips to Las Vegas are [lasvegas.com](https://www.lasvegas.com/) and [vegas.com](https://www.vegas.com/). These existing competitors could be a concern for the future of this site, which will need to build an audience amongst an established market. Unlike the competition, this site will be informational rather than promotional. This distinction could be considered both a strength and a weakness in the short term. However, in the long term, it could provide a growth opportunity to partner with local businesses once the site is established within the market.

## Audience
Las Vegas’ visitor demographics differ from its population demographics in several ways. Visitors are older \(with an average age of 45 years old\), better educated \(with 47% having a college degree\), and wealthier \(with a median household income of $100,000+\). The most popular visitor characteristics informed the Vic Fontaine persona. Vic visits Las Vegas once every year for a vacation with his partner. They plan their travel more than 90 days in advance, using travel websites for planning but airline and hotel websites for booking. The pair arrives on a weekday, staying four days and three nights in a strip corridor hotel. Although they visit 7-10 casinos during their trip, Vic and his partner only gamble at one casino for 2 hours or less. Along with gambling at the strip corridor, they enjoy a lounge act during their stay.

## Content Generation
This site is geared towards both armchair travelers and actual visitors, aiming to turn one group into the other. Its value proposition, based on the mission statement provided, is sharing valuable insiders’ knowledge with the audience, for whom the site is both inspirational \(armchair travelers\) and utilitarian \(actual visitors\). Content will be insourced from our organization, which will include a Content Manager, a Web Developer, and a Data Analyst. Material will also be crowdsourced from our audience, and the site will be updated daily.

## Trends
The industry, consumer, and content trends that the site will incorporate are all centered on technology. Industry trends include tech-led recommendations, consumer trends include interactive content, and content trends include user-generated content. Optimized site content that uses key terms like \#travel, \#lasvegas, and \#nevada will help in achieving SERP position zero, a key trend in the coming year.

## Aggregated Content
These six pieces of content were selected because, in keeping with the value proposition and mission statement provided, they highlight shared interests and provide insiders’ knowledge from experts.

## Community
The audience is a trigger event community \(the trigger event being a trip to Las Vegas\) and, as such, the brand is positioning itself as an expert. This audience prefers Flickr for photos, Twitter for links, and YouTube for videos, so audience building will be focused on these platforms. The primary focus will be on Flickr and Twitter, with YouTube following once the audience is established. Engagement will be achieved through daily social sharing and monthly photo contents and measured through platform analytics tools.

## Success Measurement
Server-based analytics systems will be employed to track metrics over time, including unique visitors, new versus returning audiences, and time spent. The goal after 6 months is to build and engage an audience on Flickr and Twitter, while the goal after 1 year is to extend that audience and engagement to YouTube.

## Site Style
The site’s primary color is night, a dark blue shade that is traditional but mysterious. The header font is Grand Hotel, a script typeface with a classic vibe, while the body font is Open Sans, a sans serif typeface with a friendly feel. The images are bright city shots, crowdsourced using Unsplash. These choices combine to give the brand a timeless look that is both exciting and inviting. The site has a clean layout with well-organized information, setting it apart from its busier competitors.

## Interactive Content
The site’s audience will be encouraged to tag their Las Vegas photos on social media using a branded hashtag. These photos will be curated and shared on the site’s social media channels and camera roll. In addition to these daily updates, there will be a monthly photo contest from which one submission will be selected to be the site’s featured image.

## Audience Communication
The site and social media channels will be used to communicate with the audience. Each will be updated daily with user-generated content and weekly with brand communications. User data will be collected using server-based and platform analytics, with the goal of achieving cross-platform audience engagement. The key performance indicators tracked will include sessions, pageviews, pages per session, new versus returning users, and referrers/referring domains. 

## Social Media
Site awareness will be driven through audience building on social media channels. User-generated content will be shared daily, while promotional posts will be shared each Friday between 4 and 6 PM. Popular hashtags, such as \#lasvegas, \#nevada, and \#travel, will be used, along with trending topics, such as \#hotel, \#parks, and \#casino. Key influencers in the area of Las Vegas travel, including Tony Shi, Raymond Yu, and Roy Prasad, will also be engaged on the Flickr platform.

## Budget
The estimated budget for the first year of operation is $250,000. This includes a support staff of three to execute this strategic plan \– a Content Manager \($53,000 per year\), a Web Developer \($68,000 per year\), and a Data Analyst \($51,000 per year\). The remaining funds would be allocated to operating expenses.
